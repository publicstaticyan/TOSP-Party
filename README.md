# The Old School Project

The "OS" Project is an open source Minecraft minigame plugin that brings classic minigames from 2012 to nowadays. The project was developed with Java under the Bukkit API.

# OS Minigames

This plugin recreates the old style of lobbys and implements some classic 2012-ish minigames

## Getting Started

Since this plugin isn't released in Spigot or Bukkit forums yet, you'll need to compile it yourself. I suggest taking a read in this topic before trying anything:

[Spigot Plugin Development](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/)

I'll increment this README with a step by step tutorial when the first release rolls out.

## Cheers!
